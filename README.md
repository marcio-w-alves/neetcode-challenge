# NeetCode / LeetCode Challenge

This repository is dedicated to the resolution of algorithmic and data-structure problems in the style of [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) and [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io). All solutions are implemented in **TypeScript**.

The purpose of this project is to practice problem-solving, reinforce algorithmic concepts, and maintain proficiency in TypeScript through structured coding challenges commonly used in technical interviews and competitive programming.

## Scope

- **Problem types:** Arrays, strings, hash maps, two pointers, sliding window, stacks, queues, linked lists, binary trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and related topics.
- **Language:** TypeScript only.
- **Style:** Solutions follow a consistent structure and naming conventions for clarity and maintainability.

## Structure

Solutions are organized by topic or pattern (e.g., by NeetCode roadmap categories) to facilitate navigation and review. Each solution includes the problem statement reference and a TypeScript implementation with appropriate time and space complexity considerations where relevant.

## Usage

You may use this repository as a reference for problem-solving patterns, TypeScript implementations, or as a base for your own practice. Ensure that your local environment has Node.js and a TypeScript toolchain configured before running or modifying the code.
